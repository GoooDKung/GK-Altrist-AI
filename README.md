# Altrist Proj.

Welcome to the Altrist Project, codename: GK-L1M Project, this is the RAG System to response to the documents user uploads to the file code itself.
The file provided at the top are the builds that. If you ask what happen to V1, well it just history at this point, ask owner to know why.

## HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM:

A. The code only works in Google Colab at the moment, at https://colab.research.google.com, then upload a file to make it work for V2, **from V3 and above are now allow direct upload from the file explorer/finder**

B. Documents are only for English At the moment, the system won't be very stable for other languages yet until localization of the language.

C. You have to supply your own key to make the code work, since there's changes in the Large Language Model Service during Version 2 and 3, C.1 will be Version 2, and C.2 will be more newer version using Claude. *Don't worry about it ChatGPT User, there will be other version that will allow to use ChatGPT instead of Claude as preferred language*

  C.1 Please supply your OpenAI Key at https://platform.openai.com, when making the API please choose an model to the selected model in the web or make an match to the code itself or can edit the program to match the version of the program.
  
  C.2 For Claude or the Version 3, Please go to https://www.anthropic.com/claude, and select **Get API Access** To receive the API Key, then Generate the key, note that you might need to match the version of the Bot in the code to the Claude's console

D. You also need to have your own key for Pinecone to make the code running, you will go to https://www.pinecone.io to access the website and follow insturction to make new account and then replace the comments to make the code running as it's intended

E. You are allow to use file above for controlled environment and test out the results as you like.
	
Enjoy the using Altrist, we will be frequently update the code and hopefully making further development such as mobile compatible or local LLM to able to run offline and on the road. Feel free to contact me at @gooodkung in discord if you have any question.
